<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

Welcome to Day 12! Check out this video reviewing inheritance, or just jump right into the problem.

You are given two classes, Student and Grade, where Student is the base class and Grade is the derived class. Completed code for Student and stub code for Grade are provided for you in the editor. Note that Grade inherits all the properties of Student.

Complete the Grade class by writing a class constructor (Grade(String,String,int,int)) and a char calculate() method. The calculate method should return the character representative of a Student's *Grade. Score as defined in this chart: Screen Shot 2016-01-08 at 8.49.10 AM.png
