<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

Welcome to Day 19! Check out a video review of interfaces here, or just jump right into the problem.

Interfaces are an important concept in Java and in a few other languages like C#.

Here you are given an interface AdvancedArithmetic which contains a method signature 
int divisorSum(int n). (The divisorSum function just takes an integer as input and return the sum of all its divisors.) Your only task is to write a class Calculator which implements the interface.

Note : The class Calculator shouldn't be public.

Good luck!

<h5>Input Format</h5>

Only one line containing integer n

<h6>Constraints</h6>

1≤n≤1000

<h5>Output Format</h5>

In the first line print "I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic" without quotes. In the next line print the sum of divisors of n as given in problem statement.

<h6>Sample Input</h6>

6

<h6>Sample Output</h6>

I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic
12

<h6>Explanation</h6>

Divisors of 6 are 1,2,3 and 6. 1+2+3+6=12.

<h5>Result</h5>

Work perfectly!
