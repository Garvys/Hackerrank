<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

Welcome to Day 7! Check out a video review of arrays here, or just jump right into the problem.

An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.

You'll be given an array of N integers, and you have to print the integers in reverse order.

Good luck!

<h5>Input Format</h5>

The first line of input contains N, the number of integers. The next line contains N integers separated by a space.

<h6>Constraints</h6>

1≤N≤1000
1≤Ai≤10000, where Ai is the ith integer in the array.

<h5>Output Format</h5>

Print the N integers of the array in the reverse order on a single line separated by a space.

<h6>Sample Input</h6>

4
1 4 3 2

<h6>Sample Output</h6>

2 3 4 1

<h5>Result</h5>

Work perfectly!
