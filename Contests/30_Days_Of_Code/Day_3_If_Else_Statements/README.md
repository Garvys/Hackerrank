<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

Welcome to Day 3! 
Check out a review of if-else statements here, or just jump right into the problem.

Using "if-else" you can perform decision making in your code. See the flowchart below (taken from wikipedia):

This problem will test your knowledge on "if-else" statements.

Given an integer N as input, check the following:

If N is odd, print "Weird".
If N is even and, in between the range of 2 and 5(inclusive), print "Not Weird".
If N is even and, in between the range of 6 and 20(inclusive), print "Weird".
If N is even and N>20, print "Not Weird".
We have given you partially completed code in the editor, complete it to solve the problem.

<h5>Input Format</h5>

There is a single line of input: integer N.

<h6>Constraints</h6> 
1≤N≤100

<h5>Output Format</h5>

Print "Weird" if the number is weird. Otherwise, print "Not Weird". Do not print the quotation marks.

<h6>Sample Input 1</h6>

3

<h6>Sample Output 1</h6>

Weird

<h6>Explanation </h6>

N=3, is odd hence the its a Weird Number.

<h6>Sample Input 2</h6>

24

<h6>Sample Output 2</h6>

Not Weird

<h6>Explanation</h6>

N=24, is >20 hence its not a Weird Number.

<h5>Result</h5>

Work perfectly!
